Course Info 


Voltage – EMF – potential difference
	voltage b/w two points is work done in carrying 1 unit of positive charge from lower potential to higher potential
	units – V  ( 6x1018 electrons)
Energy 	
	A joule of work is done in moving a Coloumb of charge thriugh a potential difference of 1V
	 units – J  ( J =  C x V ) (Coloumb x Volt);
Current
	rate of flow of electrons
	units – A (A = C/t)
current flows through things and voltages are applied across things

Rules per say 
1. Sum of the currents into a point  = Sum of the currents ou tof the point . (Kirchoff’s Current Law)
	also refered as node.
2. Things in paralled have same voltage across them (KV L)
3. P = V I  units W = J/s

Relationship b/w Voltage & Current
Resistors  - I proportional to V
Capacitors – I proportinal to rate of change of V
Diodes – I flows in only one direction
Thermistors – Temperature dependent resitor
Photoresistor – Light dependent resistor
Strain gauges – Strain-dependent resistor
3 terminal devides 
Transitors – current flow b/w two terminals is controlled by voltage at the third terminal


Resistor
Resistors are lso characterised by how much power they can safely dissipate, thier physical size, adn others such as tolerence, temperature coefficient, noise, voltage coefficient, stability with time, inductance, etc.
units Ohm R = V/I  

in amplifiers as loads for active deviecs, in bias networks, and as feedback elements.
W/ capacitors they establish time and act as filters.
To set operating currents adn signal levels
to reduce voltafe by dissipating power.
To measure currents
to discharge capacitors
precision circuits to establish current
to provide accurate voltage ratios 
to set precise gain values
in logic they act as bus and line terminators 
and as pull-up and pull down resistors
in high volatge circuits to measure voltages and equalize leakage currents and on and on

Resistors in series and parallel
In series : 
R = R1+R2   -> bigger than u begun with
In parallel:
1/R = 1/R1 +1/R2  -> smaller than u begun with

Exersice 1.1
5k and 10k
(a) in series 15k, (b)in parallel 10/3 k 
Exersice 1.2
Power = V2 / R = 144 J
Exersice 1.3
series current through R1 = R2
 =>  I1 = I2  = I
 V1/R1 = V2/R2 = V/R
V1 = V*R1/R
V2 = V* R2/R
V = V1+V2
V = V * (R1+R2)/R
R = R1 +R2

Exersice 1.4
all resistors have same voltage difference across them 
V= I1 R1 =I2 R2 =I3R3 =.....
I1 = V1/R1 
I2 = V2/R2
etc
I = I1+I2 +I3......
V/R = V/R1 +V/R2 +V/R3...
1/R =1/R1 +1/ R2.........

 Conductance G 
G= 1/R   reverse flash of resisters
units  Siemens /mho  (S = 1/ohm)

Exercise 1.5
for resistance 1k power dissipated at 15v 	= 15*15/1000 W
						= 0.225 W
and p = V2/R there fore any incfrease in resistance would only decreae power. 

Exercise 1.6
10^10 watts  at 115v  
ny resistance = >10,000,000 * 1000 watts = 115*115/ R
		R = 10000000000/13225 
resistance of new wire = 0.05 * 10^(-6) ohm /foot
current I = 10000000000/115
(a) power lost per foot =  I^2 R
			= (10^20 /13225 ) * 5*10^(-8)
			= 10^12 / 2685
			=~ 3.8ish * 10^ 8 w/foot
(b) 10^10 = 13235/ 5*feet  * 10^8
      feet     = 26.85 feet
Exercise 1.6. Optional exercise: New York City requires about
1010 watts of electrical power, at 115 volts12 (this is plausible:
10 million people averaging 1 kilowatt each). A heavy power ca-
ble might be an inch in diameter. Let’s calculate what will happen
if we try to supply the power through a cable 1 foot in diameter
made of pure copper. Its resistance is 0.05 μ Ω (5×10−8 ohms)
per foot. Calculate (a) the power lost per foot from “I 2 R losses,”
(b) the length of cable over which you will lose all 1010 watts, and
(c) how hot the cable will get, if you know the physics involved
(σ = 6 × 10−12 W/K4 cm2 ). If you have done your computations
correctly, the result should seem preposterous. What is the solu-
tion to this puzzle?






Input and output
every electrical cricuit take input (voltage) to giv output (voltage)
Transfer function H = out/ in 


Voltage Dividers
   I = Vin/(R1+R2)
    Vout = I R2

  



Vin is generally on left and Vout  is generally on right 
=> signals flow form left to right


Voltage sources and current sources
ideal voltage sources will not change ot put volatge for any amonut of load 
V =I R. But
real ones have a limit to the voltage they can provide output voltage compliance 
in addition they dont provide absolute constant current either.

A voltage source likes open circuit load and hates short circuit
A current source hates open circuit load and likes short circuit.

 











Thevenin equivalent circuit
Thévenin’s theorem states12 that any two-terminal network
of resistors and voltage sources is equivalent to a single resistor R in series with a single voltage source V.



Similarly, 
Nortons theorem 
can produce same results with single curent source and resister in parallel.
Attaching a load whose resistance is less than or even comparable to the internal resistance will reduce the output considerably. This undesirable reduction of the open-circuit voltage (or signal) by the load is called “circuit loading.”

Lest this example leave the wrong impression, we would like to emphasize again that circuits are ordinarily designed so that the load resistance is much greater than the source resistance of the signal that drives the load.

Small signal resitance
in electronic devices where I is not proportianl to V.

it is sometimes useful to know instead the slope of the V –I curve, in other words, the ratio of a small change in applied voltage to the resulting change in current through the device, ΔV /ΔI (or dV/dI).
units (ohms) and substitutes for resistance in many calculations
it is called  small signal resistance, incremental resistance or dynamic resitance.
